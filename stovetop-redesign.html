    <h3 class="problems">Overview</h3>
    <p class="edited">For the final project in our Introduction to Design course, we had to redesign a product using research we collected by interviewing other students. Cooking can often be an overwhelming experience and since most (if not all) households have a stovetop, we thought it was important to have a stovetop that can cater to needs instead of users, instead of causing more stress. <br><br><br>This is a video our group used to highlight the common issues found among users.</p>

    <h3 class="problems">Redesigning the Stovetop</h3>
    <div class="div-block">
      <h3 class="problem-1">Problem #1</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-9">Users had a difficult time cleaning their stoves, didn&#x27;t know how to take the plates apart, or didn&#x27;t have the time to disassemble and clean it thoroughly. Having a dirty stove can be dangerous in a household because it can create fire and smoke when a user is trying to cook.<br></p>
      <h3 class="problem-1">Brainstorming</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-9">To combat this issue, we thought about what would reduce the time it took for a user to clean their stove and the simplest way to do it.<br><br>Here are some ideas we thought of:<br></p><img src="images/IMG_1959.jpeg" width="517" srcset="images/IMG_1959-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, images/IMG_1959-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, images/IMG_1959-p-2000.jpeg 2000w, images/IMG_1959-p-2600.jpeg 2600w, images/IMG_1959-p-3200.jpeg 3200w, images/IMG_1959.jpeg 4032w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 222px, (max-width: 767px) 334.5px, 387.75px" alt="" class="image-26">
      <p class="paragraph-14">We decided to go with the pull out tray because it was the more convenient than the removable plates, and we didn&#x27;t have to give up the metal coils that heated faster than the flat electric stoves.</p>
      <h3 class="problem-1">High-Fidelity Redesign</h3><img src="images/Pull.png" width="279" srcset="images/Pull-p-500.png 500w, images/Pull-p-800.png 800w, images/Pull-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Pull-p-1600.png 1600w, images/Pull-p-2000.png 2000w, images/Pull.png 3306w" sizes="279px" alt="" class="image-20">
      <p class="paragraph-14">This pull out tray would catch all of the crumbs that fall between the coils. This allows users to clean under the burners without having to take apart the stovetop, and this can be easily cleaned by being wiped down.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="div-block">
      <h3 class="problem-1">Problem #2</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-9">The backplates were not used because it was hard to reach over pots and pans that were being used in the front. This is also dangerous for users because they risk the chances of knocking things over.<br></p>
      <h3 class="problem-1">Problem #3</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-9">The knobs and burners were not represented properly because the plates would be distributed in a square, while the knobs were lined up on the front side of the stove.<br></p>
      <h3 class="problem-1">Brainstorming</h3><img src="images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-21-at-9.50.11-PM.png" width="271" srcset="images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-21-at-9.50.11-PM-p-500.png 500w, images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-21-at-9.50.11-PM.png 597w" sizes="271px" alt="" class="image-21">
      <p class="paragraph-14"></p>
      <div class="text-block-2">(drawn by Ann Nguyen)</div>
      <p class="paragraph-14">To combat these two problems, we changed the mapping of the stovetop to an arch shape. The user will now have an easier time distinguishing which knob controls which plate, and also encourages them to use the plates in the back, without the risk of reaching over heated pots and pans.<br><br>We kept the bigger burners in the back and the smaller burners towards the front for user&#x27;s to quickly heat water for tea, or make a quick omelette during a busy morning. </p>

      <p class="paragraph-14">This is the high fidelity prototype of the arch layout we decided to implement to our redesign.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="div-block">
    <h3 class="problem-1">Problem #4</h3>
    <p class="paragraph-9">There weren&#x27;t any features to signify that the stove stop was on, thus users would hover their hands on top to see if it was heated. Some users also didn&#x27;t think the burners were hot enough, so they would turn the heat up all the way.<br></p>
    <h3 class="problem-1">Brainstorming</h3><img src="images/IMG_5276.jpeg" width="520" srcset="images/IMG_5276-p-500.jpeg 500w, images/IMG_5276-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, images/IMG_5276-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, images/IMG_5276-p-2000.jpeg 2000w, images/IMG_5276-p-2600.jpeg 2600w, images/IMG_5276-p-3200.jpeg 3200w, images/IMG_5276.jpeg 4032w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 222px, (max-width: 767px) 334.5px, 390px" alt="" class="image-27">
    <p class="paragraph-14">This is the sketch I created to visualize different ideas for the stovetops control system, and we would implement the lights and gradients. We wanted to figure out what would be the easiest to understand, without needing to read the instructions.</p>
    <h3 class="problem-1">Redesign</h3>
    <p class="paragraph-9">In order to signify the state at which the burners were in, we used gradients under the burners and lights surrounding the knobs. We decided to keep this combination because we thought that keeping the circular knobs would be the best idea, since users are already used to using knobs for stoves. Changing it to the sliders might be a difficult transition for the users.<br></p><img src="images/Screen-Shot-2020-01-02-at-10.24.06-PM.png" alt="" class="image-28">
    <p class="paragraph-14">These marks will represent the 5 different heat settings. Depending on the level of heat, the light will be more or less saturated, with 5 being the hottest, thus being the most saturated.</p><img src="images/Screen-Shot-2020-01-02-at-10.26.23-PM.png" alt="" class="image-29">
    <p class="paragraph-14">We also used the idea of a gradient bar, instead of the surrounding gradient, to emphasize the progress of the heating plate.</p><img src="images/Heating.png" width="563" srcset="images/Heating-p-500.png 500w, images/Heating-p-800.png 800w, images/Heating-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Heating-p-1600.png 1600w, images/Heating-p-2000.png 2000w, images/Heating.png 3306w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 296px, (max-width: 767px) 446px, 563px" alt="" class="image-24">
    <p class="paragraph-14">Once you turn on the stove, the lights surrounding the knobs will represent the user&#x27;s desired temperature, and white lights will turn on under the burners to signify that they are on.</p><img src="images/Heated.png" width="563" srcset="images/Heated-p-500.png 500w, images/Heated-p-800.png 800w, images/Heated-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Heated-p-1600.png 1600w, images/Heated-p-2000.png 2000w, images/Heated.png 3306w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 296px, (max-width: 767px) 446px, 563px" alt="" class="image-25">
    <p class="paragraph-14">Eventually, once the burner is fully heated, the gradient will match the light under the knobs, to show that it&#x27;s heated to the user&#x27;s desired temperature.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-14"></p>

  <h3 class="problems">PlateMates App</h3>
  <div class="div-block">
    <h3 class="problem-1">Problem #5</h3>
    <p class="paragraph-9">According to our users, they often forget that their stove is on because of distractions. This can be very dangerous, especially when people have left the house and their stove is still on.<br></p>
    <h3 class="problem-1">Brainstorming</h3>
    <p class="paragraph-9">Since we&#x27;re now in the age of developing everyday home products like refrigerators, lights, and TVs into smart devices, Mylinh Lac and I decided to create an app that would allow users to control their stoves through their phones, right at their fingertips, including a sensor that can detect whether or not there is someone tending to the stove.<br></p><img src="images/PlateMatesUserFlow.jpg" srcset="images/PlateMatesUserFlow-p-500.jpeg 500w, images/PlateMatesUserFlow.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 296px, (max-width: 767px) 446px, (max-width: 991px) 596px, 600px" alt="" class="image-31">
    <p class="paragraph-14">This is the user flow that Mylinh Lac came up with, making sure that every action has a screen that will follow, but also making sure to not take too much of the user&#x27;s time.</p>
